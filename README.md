### Hey there!👋 I'm Tshiamo
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ☃️

I'm all about learning and bringing cool ideas to life. Currently, I'm working with an amazing team ✨ **[@suavbeauty](https://github.com/suavbeauty)** ✨, on a beauty care marketplace with the aim of empowering stylists in every region we establish a footprint.

💈 This project takes up most of my time, but I still make time to enjoy other hobbies.

📽️ What you'll find in my profile:

📺 **Projects**: I have learnt a lot over the past few years and haven't been documenting it as well as I could have. Over time I will be sharing examples and projects that have helped me learn everything I know up to this point.

📡 **Experiments**: A couple projects to test out different algorithms and technologies that I'm interested in. 


Thanks for stopping by! Check in regularly for upcoming updates. 🔥
